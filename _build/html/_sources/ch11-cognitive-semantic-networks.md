## Tool Exploration

This week, you are encouraged to explore various tools that can be used for text network analysis. 

- A no-code [free tool to turn your texts into semantic graphs](https://nocodefunctions.com/cowo/semantic_networks_tool.html)
- [InfraNodus](https://infranodus.com/) is a network thinking tool that reveals the relations and patterns in data

Of course, you can use Python packages to develop even more advanced workflows. 

Please share what you learn back to the class.

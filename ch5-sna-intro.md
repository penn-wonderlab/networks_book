## Social Network Analysis

Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a research methodology used to study relationships, structures, and interactions within a network of individuals, groups, or entities. It provides both qualitative and quantitative insights into how connections influence behavior, information flow, and social dynamics.

As a *methodology*, SNA offers systemic guidance how to use empirical data to examine relationships, interactions, and network structures. Due to its roots in sociology, SNA reframes research questions to focus on relational patterns rather than isolated individuals. This systemic perspective ensures that researchers consider the broader context of social structures when analyzing phenomena such as collaboration, information flow, or influence. SNA offers guidance on how to define and collect relational data. It provides a systematic set of metrics that help researchers understand network properties at different levels. 

SNA is not purely *quantitative*. SNA offers both quantitative and qualitative approaches to studying relationships, structures, and interactions. While quantitative SNA focuses on measuring and modeling network properties, qualitative SNA emphasizes the interpretation of meanings, contexts, and processes within networks.

Qualitative SNA explores the meaning behind network ties, social roles, and relational dynamics. It often involves interviews, ethnographic observations, and discourse analysis to complement network graphs. There are researchers who conducts mixed-methods social network analysis. For instance, a researcher first maps a teacher collaboration network in a school using SNA. After identifying key 'influencers' (high degree centrality) and isolated teachers, they conduct qualitative interviews to explore: Why some teachers are less connected? How informal conversations impact professional development? 



## Examples of SNA and network analysis in education

As you start to define your course project, please spend time to search example use of network analysis in areas you are interested in. 

To illustrate possibilities, below are three distinct examples of using SNA and word networks. As you seek to define your own project, please spend time to think about the problem you try to solve, specific questions you'd like to answer, and data that will be needed to answer these questions. Doing so will prepare you for the upcoming project pitch.
